# Fay

## A 2D JavaScript

## Cool features

- Uses [mini-signals][mini-signals] for extremely fast events.
- Debug builds have lots of checks, all of them are stripped out in prod builds for max perf.
- Highly plugable. The core is generic and easily extensible.

## Todo:

- Texture, BaseTexture
- Tinting
- Bounds
- Masks
- Filters
- Blend mode
- Custom shaders
- DevicePixelRatio
- Interactions (https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/issues/241)
