# Shapes

The shapes plugin has some interesting utilities that are helpful when dealing with shapes.
Most notably, it contains the `BoundingBox` class which can calculate the bounding box of
an entity based on various pieces of information. It also has the `BoundsComponent` which
adds a bounding box tracker and methods to get/update it.
